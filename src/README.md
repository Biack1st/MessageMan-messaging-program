# Messageman Messaging program
the source for the message man messaging program.

## how to run
First, if you haven't already, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). This will be used to run the script. It is also recommended you install [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This will make the next steps easier.

### installing repo
In order to run the script, you must install the script. 

To do so, go to Code -> Download Zip

Once you download the folder, extract the newly downloaded folder(I assume you know how to do this, if not, just google it.)

### opening the folder
After the downloaded folder is extracted, copy the folder's path and open VS code. 

Once VS code is open, go to the topbar and click "File", then click "Open Folder."
